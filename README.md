# CS8803ACT Project
A Verilog RNN Library I made for CS8803ACT. Intending to make Python wrapper later on.

- note to self: clean up this project with newly-learned verilog/vhdl organization skills
- add my class presentations/architecture/etc to this repo
- by the time I get around to cleaning this up there will probably be new recommended activation functions. So add those too.

___
Old Run Instructions (needs to be updated)
- Open Quartus Project File "rnn.qpf" in Quartus Prime Lite
- set rnn_cell as top level design if not already
- double click Analysis & Synthesis
- open RTL viewer to see design
- open the plus signs in upper left to see underlying designs
- use project navigator => files to see the Verilog and explore files/functional tests

- set smaller modules as Top Level Entity to synthesize that and test it if desired
